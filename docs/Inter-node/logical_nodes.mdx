title: "Logic Nodes"

In some scenarios, it is necessary to enter certain nodes under different branches or logical control flow conditions, but without sharing their backends.


```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state if_state <<choice>>
    TextDetection --> if_state
    if_state --> Cut: if Width/Height > 512/32 
    if_state --> TextRecognition : if Width/Height <= 512/32
    Cut --> TextRecognition.2
    TextRecognition.2 --> Combine
    Combine --> Final
    TextRecognition --> Final
```

In the text recognition example above, we want the TextRecognition and TextRecognition.2 nodes to share the same backend instance. Using the node **name + alias** format, users can define logical nodes for physical nodes. Logical nodes can have separate logical configurations (next/filter/map) from their original physical nodes.



## Example

```toml
[in]
next="rec,rec.2"
[rec]
# default backend is Identity, which set 'result' = 'data'
next="final"
[rec.2]
next="final"
# this backend is not activated
# highlight-next-line
backend="C10Exception"
[final]
map="rec[result:data],rec.2[result:data.2]"
```

It is not difficult to test and find that:

```python
model  = torchpipe.pipe("assets/toml/logical.toml")

inputs = {"data":1}
model(inputs)
assert(inputs["result"]==inputs["data.2"])
```
