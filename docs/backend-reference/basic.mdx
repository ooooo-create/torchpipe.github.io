## Backend Expansion Rule {#backend-spread}
For backend configuration, some backends have the ability to expand, for example, for `backend="A[B]"`, it can be expanded to
```toml
backend="A"
"A::backend"="B"
```

## Identity
Does nothing but assigns the input to the output.
 
## Sequential {#sequential}
> For specific examples, please refer to [Sequential](../Intra-node/Sequential.mdx).

### Initialization
`Sequential::backend` can specify multiple sub-backends separated by commas, such as `Sequential::backend=A,B,C[D],E`.
`Sequential` expands sub-backends according to the [backend expansion rules](#backend-spread) to obtain:
```toml
backend="E"
```

```toml
backend="C"
C::backend="D"
```

```toml
backend="B"
```

```toml
backend="A"
```
Sub-backend initialization will be performed in reverse order.
:::info
`Sequential` can be composed, for example:<br />
`S[S[DecodeTensor,ResizeTensor],(or)S[DecodeMat,ResizeMat,Mat2Tensor,SyncTensor],SyncTensor]`.
:::
:::tip Repeating Backend Parameters
Sub-backends of `Sequential` may have duplicates. If you need to specify different parameters for sub-backends, you can use the `|` symbol:
```toml
backend="Sequential[a,b,Jump,c,Jump]"
jump="||node_name_1||node_name_2"
# 或者，任意的占位符都是可以的： 
# jump="a|b|node_name_1|c|node_name_2"
```
:::
### Forward
When forwarding, sub-backends are executed in series. If the result of a non-final sub-backend is empty, the execution is terminated and an exception is thrown. If the result of a non-final sub-backend is non-empty, the filter will be executed. The default is `swap`.

### Input Range
If the input data range of all sub-backends is [1,1], then the range of `Sequential` is [1,1]. Otherwise, it is the union of the input ranges of sub-backends whose input ranges are not [1,1]. **Currently, only one sub-backend is allowed to satisfy `max() != 1 && max() != UINT32_MAX` at most**. In `Sequential`, currently only one sub-backend with non-trivial input range is allowed at most, and this sub-backend can be regarded as the main functional implementer of the entire `Sequential`, while other backends are auxiliary or functional backends.
