title: Custom Backend

We have found that a major problem in business is that the preset backends (computational backend/scheduling backend/RPC backend/cross-process backend, etc.) cannot cover all requirements. Typically, extending the backend is not the task of the `user`, but rather the task of the `library developer`. `Torchpipe` holds a different perspective, believing that the backend itself is also an API oriented towards the `user`. Therefore, the backend must be designed to be simple enough. Drawing on the design of frameworks such as GStreamer and FFmpeg, and targeting modern C++ and Python, `Torchpipe` hopes that the backend:
- Is granular enough
- Does not require any special input/output data types, with the backend author responsible for type validation and management
- As an API, the `user` only needs to pay attention to the usage rules of **basic types (dict)** and the **optional logging component**, both of which can be re-implemented and globally overridden. No other C++ elements are required. Although this approach can easily lead to code confusion, it greatly gives the `user` freedom to extend.
- Provides AOT compilation, especially in Python environments. 

## Basic Types
### any
Similar to `std::any` in C++17, we have defined a type-erased container, `ipipe::any`, with an almost identical interface. It can accept any type of data except `char*` and `unsigned char*`. Data of the `any` type can be retrieved using `any_cast` to obtain the actual data. 

```cpp
T data = any_cast<T>(any_data);
// or
auto* pdata = any_cast<T>(&any_data);
```
### dict
As a data carrier, similar to Python's `dict`, we have also defined the following `dict` in C++:
```cpp
#ifndef CUSTOM_DICT
using dict = std::shared_ptr<std::unordered_map<std::string, ipipe::any>>;
#else
// todo :  custom dict with bidirectional binding between C++ and Python
#endif
```


### Backend
Torchpipe limits the basic elements of the backend to:
- Initialization: parameter configuration
- Forward: input/output interface
- Forward: batch range of data

The backend interface is defined as follows:

```cpp
class Backend {
 public:
  // The configuration will be passed through to the first parameter of `init`
  virtual bool init(const std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& config, dict dict_config) {
    return true;
  };

  virtual void forward(const std::vector<dict>& input_dicts) = 0;

  virtual uint32_t max() const { return 1; };
  virtual uint32_t min() const { return 1; };
  ... //Irrelevant Functions
};
```

 You can customize the backend, for example, the internal `Identity` can be defined equivalently in the following `CustomIdentity.cpp` file:

```cpp
#include "torchpipe/extension.h"

namespace ipipe {
class CustomIdentity : public Backend {
 public:
  void forward(const std::vector<dict>& input_dicts) override {
    (*input_dicts[0])[TASK_RESULT_KEY] = input_dicts[0]->at(TASK_DATA_KEY);
  }
  uint32_t max() const override final { return 1; }; // or directly inherit from SingleBackend
};

// Register with the system
IPIPE_REGISTER(Backend, CustomIdentity, "CustomIdentity");
}  // namespace ipipe
```

Compared to the [triton inference server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend), the backend here has fewer requirements. Users generally only need to extend `init/forward`. If batching functionality is required, then `max/min` needs to be modified. In our practice, providing these elements in the backend is sufficient as long as the [basic assumptions](./model_parallel#assumption) are met. Torchpipe implements all the functions through the composite of backends. In fact, `torchpipe` itself is a composite of backends.

## Compilation {#compile}
For convenient compilation, we use the [`torch.utils.cpp_extension`](../python/compile) AOT compilation facility to complete the rapid custom extension of the backend in the Python environment.

```python
from torchpipe.utils.cpp_extension import load
from torchpipe import pipe
## Load C++
load(sources=["CustomIdentity.cpp"])

## Initialization
model = pipe({"backend":"CustomIdentity", "instance_num":"2"})

## Forward
input = {"data":"123"}
model(input)

## Check result
assert(input["result"] == b"123")
```

## Binding with Python
When using Python as the front-end language, the back-end is called from Python and the results are returned to Python, requiring type conversion.
### From Python Types to Any {#py2any}
Assuming the input data is
```python
input = {"data":py_object}
```
The framework converts the Python object `py_object` to a C++ object according to [certain rules](../cpp-python/basic#py2cpp);


For the Python dictionary `input`, the corresponding C++ code is:
```cpp
dict input_cpp = std::make_shared<std::unordered_map<std::string, ipipe::any>>();
(*input_cpp)["data"] = PY2CPP(py_object);
```

After the conversion, the data will be sent to the back-end for processing as a `dict`. Users can specify the data type `T` in the back-end and obtain the real data through the following API:

```cpp
T data = any_cast<T>((*input_cpp)["data"]);
// or
auto* pdata = any_cast<T>(&(*input_cpp)["data"]);
```

If `T` is inconsistent with the actual `C++` type, an exception will be thrown or a null pointer will be returned.

### From `any` to Python Types {#any2py}
When the back-end writes the results and other key values to `input_cpp`, if the Python interface is needed, the framework will automatically transmit the data corresponding to all key values except `data` to the Python end according to [certain rules](../cpp-python/basic#cpp2py).
