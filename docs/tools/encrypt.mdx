torchpipe comes with built-in simple encryption functionality.

:::tip
Please specify the `IPIPE_KEY` key (greater than 8 characters, 16 characters recommended) when compiling `torchpipe` to enable the relevant functionality:

```bash
# The following key is just an example. Please do not use this key.
IPIPE_KEY=9876tfyghyughyuihjk python setup.py bdist_wheel
# or IPIPE_KEY=9876tfyugkjhyuihjk pip instal -e .
```
:::

## Example
```bash
python -m torchpipe.utils.encrypt a.onnx a.onnx.encrypted
```

## Usage {#encrypt-parameter}
 `usage: encrypt.py [-h] input output`






The output file with the `.encrypted` suffix can be used with [TensorrtTensor](../backend-reference/torch#tensorrttensor).

## Encryption Security

We use symmetric encryption, as well as some frame selection and obfuscation strategies for encryption in our source code. The encryption strategy may change with version updates and other factors. Please specify the key `IPIPE_KEY` (greater than 8 bits, 16 bits is optimal) when compiling `torchpipe`. We only provide basic encryption functionality. You can implement the entire encryption and decryption part yourself to achieve more secure protection.
