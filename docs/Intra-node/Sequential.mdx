# Sequential

`Sequential` can link multiple backends together. In other words, `Sequential[DecodeTensor,ResizeTensor,cvtColorTensor,SyncTensor]` and `Sequential[DecodeMat,ResizeMat]` are valid backends.

During the forward execution of `Sequential[DecodeMat,ResizeMat]`, the data (dict) will go through the following process in sequence:
- Execute `DecodeMat`: `DecodeMat` reads `data` and assigns the result to `result` and `color`.
- Conditional control flow: attempts to assign the value of `result` in the data to `data` and deletes `result`.
- Execute `ResizeMat`: `ResizeMat` reads `data` and assigns the result to the `result` key.

`Sequential` can be abbreviated as `S`. API reference can be found in [`Sequential`](../backend-reference/basic#sequential).
## Conditional Control Flow Filter {#filter_sequential}
`Sequential` itself implements support for control flow syntax extensions. In fact, `S[DecodeMat,ResizeMat]` is equivalent to `S[(Run)DecodeMat,(swap)ResizeMat]`.

The filters in `()` parentheses can return the following states:
- Run, which means that the current sub-backend can be skipped and wait to enter the next sub-backend (Effective from v0.3.2b1; `Continue` can be used in previous versions.)
- Break, which means to exit the execution of `Sequential`
- Error, which means an error occurred
- SerialSkip, which means that consecutive serial sub-backends can be skipped, equivalent to Break in `Sequential`
- SubGraphSkip, which means that consecutive subgraphs can be skipped, equivalent to Break in `Sequential`

Here are some built-in filter definitions:

<Tabs groupId="filter"  className="unique-tabs">
<TabItem value="Run" label="Run">

```cpp
#include "filter.hpp"

class FilterRun : public Filter {
 public:
  status forward(dict data) override { return Filter::status::Run; }
};
IPIPE_REGISTER(Filter, FilterRun, "Run,run");
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swap" label="swap">

```cpp
class Filter {
 public:
  enum struct status { Run, Skip, SerialSkip, SubGraphSkip, Break, Error };

  virtual bool init(const std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& /*config*/,
                    dict /*dict_config*/) {
    return true;
  };

  virtual status forward(dict input) {
    auto iter = input->find(TASK_RESULT_KEY);
    if (iter == input->end()) {
      return status::Break;
    }

    (*input)[TASK_DATA_KEY] = (*input)[TASK_RESULT_KEY];
    input->erase(iter);
    return status::Run;
  }

  virtual ~Filter() = default;
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
For more information on filters, please refer to [the detailed filter documentation](../Inter-node/filter).
Based on this, as will be discussed in the next section on [extending and compiling custom backends](./extensible_backend), users can easily define their own conditional control flow.
## Response of Conditional Control Flow to Input Range Changes
Suppose there is a backend `S[DecodeTensor,(swap)TensorrtTensor,TensorrtSync]`, where the input range of `DecodeTensor` is [1,1], and the range of `TensorrtTensor` is [1,4]. According to the [Sequential rule for calculating input range](../backend-reference/basic#sequential), the input range of Sequential is [1,4].

If four data enter this Sequential at the same time, but one of them fails to decode, then
- One data returns `status::Break` in `swap`, while the others return `status::Run`.
- `Sequential` continues to send the remaining three data to the next stage, while the data in `Break` state terminates the execution in Sequential.

The above describes the response when encountering `Break` for some data; similarly, when encountering `Skip` for some data, the data will be locally processed in a similar way. However, when a data is in `Error` state, Sequential will consider the overall task status as `Error`. If this contradicts the user's intention, the user can try to split the sub-backends into different Sequentials to avoid mutual interference. Note that the `Error` state is generally extremely rare and unexpected.
