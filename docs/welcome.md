# Welcome to the TorchPipe Documentation!


Torchpipe is a multi-instance pipeline parallel library that acts as a bridge between lower-level acceleration libraries and RPC frameworks, ensuring a strict decoupling from them. It offers a thread-safe function interface for the PyTorch frontend at a higher level, while empowering users with fine-grained backend extension capabilities at a lower level. It maximizes service throughput while meeting latency requirements.


This document will be continuously updated along with the code changes. You can:

- Learn the TorchPipe documentation and quickly get started with the TorchPipe library.
- Participate in open source development, track document updates, and become a contributor to the TorchPipe documentation.
- Join the TorchPipe community, meet peers, and participate in more discussions and exchanges.

Now, let's start the journey of exploring the official TorchPipe documentation!
